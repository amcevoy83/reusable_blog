        "content": "I Was There (Danann, \u20ac10), a 30-page paperback, frames a daunting scientific story in terms that gallop along. The author is Michael Casey, who watches the stars from Newport, Co Mayo; the illustrator is Olivia Golden, her images glowingly pitched for the rapture of Christmas morning.\r\nThe supermoons this autumn and all the talk of life on Mars give a topical edge to this hard-won distillation of cosmic, earthly and human evolution. Casey\u2019s text, engaging both minds and hearts of children, makes an elevating read at any age.\r\n\r\nOn a different scale, and with its own large ambition, comes Michael O\u2019Meara\u2019s Sea Gastronomy: Fish and Shellfish of the North Atlantic (Artisan House, \u20ac30). Beautifully produced and illustrated, at the weight of a decent hake, with 440 pages and 235 recipes, it has the promise of a modern Escoffier of fish cuisine. It is also an excellent plain cook\u2019s guide to how to tackle a whole fish or crab as it comes from the sea rather than anonymous supermarket fillets.",
